<p class="w3">The recorded file was saved on the Raspberry Pi as a .wav file and converted to .mp3 through editing.</p>
<p class="w4">We took into account the emotions contained in the collected response data and separated them into one of three groups: positive, neutral, and negative. 20% of the answers contained negative emotions, 30% contained positive emotions, and 50% contained neutral emotions. Most participants preferred short answers, and those who answered longer than 5 seconds mostly included positive emotions in their answers.
